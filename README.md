Mod ads some simple changes to the ui and ads a background

Makes it easier to see the background over the buttons ui

_credits to the pixelclient for the idea_

![main menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mitzingdash/Better-Main-Menu/master/resources/MainMenu.png)

for now there is only one image for the background and one image for the logo. But that will change!

The mod is compatible with mod menu in the seance it will remove the "Mod" button if mod menu isn't present

The mod supports sinytra connector but is not recommended on using it.
